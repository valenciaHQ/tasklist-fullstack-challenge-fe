# Tasklist Frontend

* Make sure you have backend up an running. Check [This](https://github.com/valenciaHQ/tasklist-fullstack-challenge-be/blob/main/readme.md) backend readme.
* Run me using `npm install` and `npm run start`
* At root, you will need to define one environment variable that will point to the API. For localhost: `REACT_APP_BASE_API_URL=http://localhost:3001/api/v1`

### After is running please visit _/readme_ for some notes and thoughts.

Hope we can meet!
